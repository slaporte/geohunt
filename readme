Geohunt, version 1

Geohunt generates a list of Wikipedia articles that need photographs.

== Why? ==
I wanted to make it easy to find things to photograph, and I figured that geotags are a good place to start. There are certainly non-geotagged articles that also need photographs:

* http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Requested_photos
* http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Photo_scavenger_hunts
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Takes_The_City
* http://toolserver.org/~contests/startahunt.php

== To do ==
* Search result limit
* Manual input of WGS84 lat/long (currently spherical mercator)
* More percise search range (currently +/- lat long calculated by zoom level)
* Format result page for printing
* Query DBpedia in languages other than EN
* Cache generated lists, with static maps?
* Better navigation on search map--text search for place?
* Reverse geo look up street addresses for results?

== External sites  ==

=== Maps ===
All the maps are generated by OpenLayer from Open Street Maps.

* http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page

=== DBpedia ===
This script relies on information from DBpedia 3.6, based on Wikipedia dumps from October/November 2010. DBpedia is a great way to query Wikipedia for structured information. Geohunt communicates with DBpedia through the SPARQL endpoint.
